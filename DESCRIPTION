Description: Sequencing and microarray samples often are collected or processed 
    in multiple batches or at different times. This often produces technical 
    biases that can lead to incorrect results in the downstream analysis. 
    BatchQC is a software tool that streamlines batch preprocessing and 
    evaluation by providing interactive diagnostics, visualizations, and 
    statistical analyses to explore the extent to which batch variation impacts 
    the data. BatchQC diagnostics help determine whether batch adjustment needs 
    to be done, and how correction should be applied before proceeding with a 
    downstream analysis. Moreover, BatchQC interactively applies multiple common
    batch effect approaches to the data, and the user can quickly see the 
    benefits of each method. BatchQC is developed as a Shiny App. The output is 
    organized into multiple tabs, and each tab features an important part of the
    batch effect analysis and visualization of the data. The BatchQC interface 
    has the following analysis groups: Summary, Differential Expression, 
    Median Correlations, Heatmaps, Circular Dendrogram, PCA Analysis, Shape, 
    ComBat and SVA.
